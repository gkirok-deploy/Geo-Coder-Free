=head1 NAME

Geo::Coder::Free - Provides a geocoding functionality using free databases

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.05';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Geo::Coder::Free;

    my $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Free->new();
    my $location = $geocoder->geocode(location => 'Ramsgate, Kent, UK');

    # Use a local download of http://results.openaddresses.io/
    my $openaddr_geocoder = Geo::Coder::Freee->new(openaddr => $ENV{'OPENADDR_HOME'});
    $location = $openaddr_geocoder->geocode(location => '1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington DC, USA');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geo::Coder::Free provides an interface to free databases by acting as a front-end to
Geo::Coder::Free::MaxMind and Geo::Coder::Free::OpenAddresses.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Free->new();

Takes one optional parameter, openaddr, which is the base directory of
the OpenAddresses data downloaded from http://results.openaddresses.io.

Takes one optional parameter, directory,
which tells the library where to find the MaxMind and GeoNames files admin1db, admin2.db and cities.[sql|csv.gz].
If that parameter isn't given, the module will attempt to find the databases, but that can't be guaranteed.

sub new {
	my($proto, %param) = @_;
	my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

	# Geo::Coder::Free->new not Geo::Coder::Free::new
	return unless($class);

	my $rc = {
		maxmind => Geo::Coder::Free::MaxMind->new(%param)
	};

	if($param{'openaddr'}) {
		$rc->{'openaddr'} = Geo::Coder::Free::OpenAddresses->new(%param);
	}
	if(my $cache = $param{'cache'}) {
		$rc->{'cache'} = $cache;
	}

	return bless $rc, $class;
}

=head2 geocode

    $location = $geocoder->geocode(location => $location);

    print 'Latitude: ', $location->{'latt'}, "\n";
    print 'Longitude: ', $location->{'longt'}, "\n";

    # TODO:
    # @locations = $geocoder->geocode('Portland, USA');
    # diag 'There are Portlands in ', join (', ', map { $_->{'state'} } @locations);

		if(my $rc = $self->{'openaddr'}->geocode(@_)) {
			return $rc;
		}
	}

	return $self->{'maxmind'}->geocode(@_);
}

=head2 reverse_geocode

    $location = $geocoder->reverse_geocode(latlng => '37.778907,-122.39732');

To be done.

sub reverse_geocode {
	Carp::croak('Reverse lookup is not yet supported');
}

=head2	ua

Does nothing, here for compatibility with other geocoders

=head1 BUGS

Lots of lookups fail at the moment.

The openaddresses.io code has yet to be compeleted.
There are die()s where the code path has yet to be written.

The MaxMind data only contains cities.
The openaddresses data doesn't cover the globe.

Can't parse and handle "London, England".

Openaddresses look up is slow.
See L<Geo::Coder::Free::OpenAddresses> for instructions on improving the speed by
storing the data in an SQLite database.
